Quizzler:

This is an IOS Quiz Application built using Swift.

I have followed Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern for developing this Application.

The Quiz contains 13 questions and for each question there are 2 options (True/False) and there is a 
Progress bar that keeps tracks of the questions , and a score label that keeps track of users score. 

Once the users completes the quiz , user will be given an option to restart the quiz.

Finished App:
